# School_District_Analysis
# Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze a school disticts funding and student grades statistics and visual matterials to clearly show the results and testing standards of the school district. In the process, we performed the analysis twice, and this is because of the fact that the integrity of results for math and reading of Thomas High School ninth graders were being questionable.

# Resources:
- Data Source: missing_grades.csv, schools_complete.csv, students_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.7, Jupyter Notebook.

# Results:
Because of the fact that the intergrity of the results of the Thomas High School ninth graders math and readings were found errorneors, they were replaced with NaN and were not considered in the calculations.

 Replacing the ninth graders math and reading scores affected Thomas High School not in a good way in my opinion, because since the results were incomplete, replacing them with     NaN  helped the school district in getting more accurate data in terms of spending and students performance, but it affected the overall performance of Thomas High School.
